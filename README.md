# Fract'ol | fractals | "broken", "fractured"
<i>Summary: This project is meant to create graphically beautiful fractals.</i><br><br>
This C project is about two-dimensional graphical modeling of mathematical fractal shapes. The final program should be capable of producing infinitely recurring fractal shapes with the parameter applied. This C program is tagged with my school's "42" user account "aviholai".

MiniLibraryX (MLX) is a 42School graphical library used in the graphics branch projects, such as this one. For more information regarding MLX and understanding it, I recommend checking out this guide by <a href="https://github.com/harm-smits">@harm-smits</href>: <a href="https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/introduction.html">42 Docs: MiniLibX</href><br><br>

# How to use.
1. Compile the binary in the repository with command <i>make</i> 
2. Apply argument as parameter when launching the program, representing a number (1 to 3) to a different fractal pattern. <i>./fractol \<number> </i>
3. If your command is viable the graphical window should launch, otherwise you should get an error message in the standard output. <br><br> 
<b>Controls for Mac and Linux:</b> <br> 
• Moving the mouse pans the fractal image. This also further progresses the symmetry of the Julia fractal. <br>
• Clicking the mouse switches between the different fractal patterns. <br>
• Scrolling the mouse wheel zooms in and out in the fractal, applying further iterations. <br>
• Press `ESC` to quit the program. <br>
As the program was initially planned for school computer use, the keyboard controls may not be hooked properly to other than MacOS. <br>

# To do. | Future capacities.

• Compatibility with different OS (with MiniLibraryX and keyboard controls). <br>
• Further optimisation, to make the heavy mathematical iterations refresh more smoothly. <br>
• Possibility to lock the aspect and position of the fractal, while, for example, zooming into it. <br>
• Motion hooked to keyboard arrow keys (this is a bonus feature in the school subject file). <br>
• Etc. <br>
